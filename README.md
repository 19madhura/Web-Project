Presenting the **Library Management System Web Project**, this sophisticated platform is composed of two primary services. The **Book Management Module** allows for a variety of functionalities, including the addition of new titles, updating existing records, deletion, and an advanced search feature that filters through parameters such as author names, pricing, publication year, page count, and more. The **Member Services Module** is designed to manage user memberships efficiently, providing capabilities to register new members, update member information, and remove memberships as required. This entire system is crafted utilizing **Spring boot with JPA** for robust data handling, **HTML** for structure, and **Bootstrap** for aesthetic styling, ensuring a seamless user experience.
